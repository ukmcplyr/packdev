# PackDev

PackDev (PD for short) is a suite of tools with one goal: automation of remedial
and/or time-consuming tasks, frequently performed during development life cycle
of Minecraft modpacks, so that more time can be spent actually developing and
far less time running shell commands in series to implement, test, verify and
commit a feature of changeset.
